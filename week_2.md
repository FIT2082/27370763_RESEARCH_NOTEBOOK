I and Surayez will be working on "When is an edge not an edge?".

We have met our instructor, Lachlan on Wednesday, 1st of August, and there are the things we have talked about:
  We have looked some graphs of the result by the code by Lachlan and knowing some details of the project.
  We will be analysing users' energy consumption and use computer to identify when is an edge not an edge,
  that means we have to look at the standard deviation and the mean of that period of time. For example, if 
  SD is great with the same mean value comparing to a small SD, we cannot say the edge with great SD is an edge.
  So our job is to first find out the standard deviation of each period of time, the mean, and analyse them by setting
  the period of time sd and mean to see if there is an edge or not (eg if a week, deviation is low, edge!)
  And we are trying to translate the matlab code and waiting for some sample datasets.
  
PROGRESS:
- converting matlab data into python arrays
