This week, very few research was done as the change in our supervisor.

However, we have met Mahsa on Friday and we explained to her about our project and what we have done so far. So, our progress is that we have completed the statistical method for our edge-finding algorithm and the algorithm works well with most of the datasets.

As stated in our project specification, we will be focusing on machine learning algorithm in order to find edges in different datasets. Mahsa suggested us to look at autoregression algorithm that acutally predicts the path or edges in the following pixel, using some mathematical ways including linear algebra, but we will consider in finding libraries in python instead of implementing the algorithm ourselves.

The final goal in implementing the algorithm will be that we want to compare machine learning with statistical methods when classifying edges.

Target next week:
Implement autoregression and start testing the algorithm
