On Wednesday, I have a meeting with Lachlan and other master students who are also working with Lachlan to discuss more on the
research topic. Lachlan also mentioned some points we should aware when doing our project specification. On the other side, me and sorayez are working on the documents of our project specification. Not much research has been done this week as most of the time we have been doing the specification. We hope to translate the code next week and start working on it.

We successfully convert the dataset file into python data, and has successfully output some graphs in python.

While we have tried some edge detection techniques (finding the standard deviation of each day, which is incorrect approach):

Lachlan told us to focus on mean- standard deviation ratio while for now, we will be focusing on data cleaning and finish translating the edge detection algorithm. After the algorithm is successfully translated, our research can start. After successfully classifying edges, we can look at different machine learning algorithm such as Long-Short term memory and using panda later. Anyway, the most important things to do now is to extract the edges out for processing.
